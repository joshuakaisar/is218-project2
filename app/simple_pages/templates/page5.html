    Instantiation mean to call the constructor of a class that creates an instance or object of the type of that class. Object object is a member (also called an instance) of a class. Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state. Class a template used to create objects and to define object data types and methods. Namespaces allow programmers to create small private areas in which to declare classes. Constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. Fixture define the steps and data that constitute the arrange phase of a test. Type hint. Type cast the data types of objects are converted using predefined functions by the user. Unit testing is a technique in which particular module is tested to check by developer himself whether there are any errors. Static means that the member is on a class level rather on the instance level. Instance method are called because they can access unique data of their instance. Instance property is a Python variable belonging to only one object. Static method are methods that are bound to a class rather than its object. Static property means that the member is on a class level rather on the instance level. Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions that work on that data within a single object. Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. Polymorphism defines methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. Abstraction is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it.
